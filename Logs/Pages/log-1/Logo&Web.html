            So to start a few things off for this logbook of making this game this is a one man team of me myself and I but at some point I do want more people involved as a one man team for a 
            game of this size is a long task and with my limited skill and the fact I am a college student and am not the best at making lore let alone anything consistent so at some point I will 
            need other people to join a team but for now it's just the basics and I can do that myself. 
            As of writing this my skillset is Maya modelling, Painter for texturing, UE5 for the game engine (still need to figure out the coding aspect, I cannot make anything do something for the 
            life of me). But I will hopefully learn everything that I need to throughout this project, kind of already been proved this by re-learning how to make websites for this.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            To start off this process I did some idea generation with the help of ChatGPT to refine the ides (the idea of the game itself, and all aspects thought of are mine I just asked GPT to help put my thoughts into better 
            words than 'open world survival' like every other game on the market). But some basic ideas that I have are where it's located as the place is hopefully (massive space) is Sacramento, Santa Rosa
            and Stockton, I don't have a reason why other than I wanted the place to be the west coast but not be in San Fransisco even though this map borders it, the time that this place is set is 2050 
            so not too far into the future but will still have slightly more advanced tech than what we have today, so I'll be using loads of referances on things that are in the real world now but add a bit 
            more technology that could be realistic.
            <br>
            <br>
            I am planning on making a page of all the ideas as a checklist and many different lists as the locations I will need to make a list for and what kind of buildings I would need to make, what areas I want destroyed, I 
            still haven't decided how the world is now a wasteland. So to start this process I am going to make a text doc on what I need to do then list it out on a list web page.
            <br>
            <br>
            But right now I don't know the pricing of the game as if this was made by a triple A company it would be $60 but I'm thinking closer to $20 and $15 on first day as it's one guy and I don't need a 
            wage for this as it is just a project right now but it would be nice to make some money from this. If anyone helps with the making of the game, things such as new ideas (in detail not just 'add this' 
            'add that'), models, textures of models, concept art, and other things only if I add them to the game, they will get a free copy and the people who have contributed will be put in the credits of the game, obviously
            if they want to be credited, and if they are how they would be for protection of them.

            Now we get onto the actual log, apologies for mess of words above and the massively vague idea of what I am going to do but this page was for how I'm starting the making of this game, but to get onto what the title 
            of this is actually about, so I will start with the logo shown below, the way I made this was by going onto canva and adding a tree background and changing the colour of the tree to white then added the title of 
            the game Echos Of Eden and placed it just below the leaves and centred, then changed the font from the boring Comic Sans to something I can't remember, then changed the colour to a grey. I <B>tried</B> to export
            the image with a transparent background but I ended up with a black baground because I don't want to pay for Canva Premium. So I used photoshop to remove the black background by hand which was a pain 
            but I got it done after hours of working on it, yes hours, probably could of found an easier way around it but I'm an idiot so it's fine. And that is all for how I made the logo, is it going to stay like this through
            out the whole project yes, yes it will I am <b>NOT</b> doing this again.
            <br>

            For the website I started by making a folder in this projects folder, as I am writing this I do realize I should make a GitHub web page so I can upload this code but I will do it all once I've finished at least 
            this log and made the other page where I have all my ideas spread out, so I named the folder "WEB" and added 2 sub-folders of "home" and "log" then added a html and css file to the "home" file and added an image 
            folder to both so I could organise the images, I say organise but it's more of have them somewhere, then I added a "Pages" folder then 3 folders called "log-" with the number at the end and a html and css file to 
            each folder, the number of these folders will be increased with the number of logs I have, there will probably be shit tons. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Now the actual code comes along so I obviously started by adding a head then linking the CSS and the fonts used, then I added a bit that would be used later of style even though I have a css file, I just find 
            animations better to do in the html file, no clue why. So I finally added a body then started with the header so I added a div then a sub div with an ID and changed some stuff in the css file and made it look 
            like how it is now, I also changed the background colour and made all the text white. Then I added the logo and resized it to make it the same height as the title, after this I started on the bottom header 
            so I added 2 of the buttons for discord and twitter, I don't have a twitter account for this (yet) so I just linked the base twitter page, I however have made a discord because that's easy to do. Then I added a 
            little disclaimer saying all this work is mine and if it is not I will reference what I have used. Finally for the home page I added a way to get to the log pages by adding a box with an animation when hovered
            over, it's easier to show than explain so the code is below.
            <br>

            <br>
            <br>
            When making this page I started by copying the code from the home page and removing the main body (log selection) and changing it to a paragraph based div thing, no clue how to explain it so another 
            screenshot.
