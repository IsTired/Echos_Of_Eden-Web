        So I started this long process by modelling my first weapon, at heart I am an enviroment artist so this was a new thing to me and as of writing this after making the model (and like usual 
        forgetting to get screenshots) I have moved onto making the first scene, but this is the first of many many challanges ahead as I still need to learn how to animate and figure out how to 
        make a character move with an animation and shoot with an animation, and die and so so many more things.
        <br>
        For the first moddel I made a glock-19 with a mag and 9mm bullet, need to texture it still but I have made progress, and this is a short one as I haven't done a great deal but it's a step 
        forwards in production. (image of final model bellow)

        Today I have also found a software that I will be using in the next dev log called Tree It, this will be added to the software list but here is a link bellow, I got thr free version but if 
        it's good I might invest in the full version because it's only Â£3.50
        <br>

        Just to say before ending this, although this is "16 days" of work in reality I was really busy during this time and didn't have a great deal of time for this project and I am hopefully 
        starting a new job soon which I will have the hours I am hoping of 25 a week so I will have some income finally which means even less time towards making this project unfortunately.
